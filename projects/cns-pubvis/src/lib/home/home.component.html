  <h2 class="title science-map">Science Map</h2>
  <p class="description science-map">
    The UCSD map of science and classification system was computed using
    paper-level data from about 25,000 journals from Elsevier's Scopus and and
    Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS) for the years 2001-2010. The UCSD map
    of science assigns the 25,000 journals to 554 subdisciplines that are further
    aggregated into 13 main disciplines of science. In the map, each discipline
    has a distinct color (green for 'Biology', brown for 'Earth Sciences', etc.)
    and a label. (Sub)disciplines that are similar closer to one another on the
    map. (Sub)disciplines that are especially similar are connected by grey lines.
    The details of how this map was created are published in PLOS One.
